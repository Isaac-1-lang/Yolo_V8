# 🗑️ Waste Category Solution Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

Your trained YOLOv8 model has different categories than what you want:

**Model's Actual Categories:**
- BIODEGRADABLE, CARDBOARD, GLASS, METAL, PAPER, PLASTIC

**Your Desired Categories:**
- Glass, Organic, Others, Packaged, Plastic

## ✅ **Solution Options**

I've created two solutions for you:

### **Option 1: Category Mapping (Recommended - Quick Fix)**
Use the existing trained model with intelligent category mapping.

### **Option 2: Retrain Model (Complete Solution)**
Retrain the model with your exact desired categories.

---

## 🎯 **Option 1: Category Mapping Solution**

### **What I've Created:**
1. **Category Mapper** (`category_mapper.py`) - Maps model categories to your desired ones
2. **Updated Streamlit App** - Now shows your desired categories
3. **Updated data.yaml** - Reflects actual model categories

### **Category Mapping:**
```
BIODEGRADABLE → Organic
CARDBOARD     → Packaged
GLASS         → Glass
METAL         → Others
PAPER         → Packaged
PLASTIC       → Plastic
```

### **How to Use:**
```bash
# Test the mapping
python category_mapper.py

# Launch the updated Streamlit app
cd "streamlit-detection-tracking - app"
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ **Immediate solution** - Works with your existing trained model
- ✅ **No retraining needed** - Saves time and computational resources
- ✅ **Intelligent mapping** - Maps similar categories logically
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Shows your desired categories in the interface

### **Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Some categories are combined (e.g., CARDBOARD + PAPER → Packaged)
- ⚠️ Not perfect 1:1 mapping

---

## 🔄 **Option 2: Retrain Model Solution**

### **Steps to Retrain:**

1. **Update Dataset Labels:**
   - Modify your dataset labels to use the desired categories
   - Update label files to map old categories to new ones

2. **Update data.yaml:**
   ```yaml
   names:
   - Glass
   - Organic
   - Others
   - Packaged
   - Plastic
   nc: 5
   ```

3. **Retrain the Model:**
   ```bash
   python train_new_model.py
   ```

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ **Perfect accuracy** - Model trained specifically for your categories
- ✅ **No mapping needed** - Direct category output
- ✅ **Better performance** - Optimized for your specific use case

### **Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ **Time-consuming** - Requires retraining (several hours)
- ⚠️ **Computational cost** - Needs GPU for efficient training
- ⚠️ **Data preparation** - May need to relabel dataset

## 🚀 **Quick Start (Recommended)**

### **Use the Category Mapping Solution:**

1. **Test the mapping:**
   ```bash
   cd "Train/Waste-Classification-using-YOLOv8"
   python category_mapper.py
   ```

2. **Launch the updated app:**
   ```bash
   cd "streamlit-detection-tracking - app"
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Upload an image and see the mapped results!**

## 📊 **Category Mapping Details**

| Original Model Category | Your Desired Category | Reasoning |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| BIODEGRADABLE | Organic | Both represent biodegradable waste |
| CARDBOARD | Packaged | Cardboard is packaging material |
| GLASS | Glass | Direct match |
| METAL | Others | Metal doesn't fit other categories |
| PAPER | Packaged | Paper is often packaging material |
| PLASTIC | Plastic | Direct match |

## 🛠️ **Files Created/Updated**

### **New Files:**
- `category_mapper.py` - Main mapping utility
- `streamlit-detection-tracking - app/category_mapper.py` - App-specific mapper
- `CATEGORY_SOLUTION_GUIDE.md` - This guide

### **Updated Files:**
- `data.yaml` - Updated to reflect actual model categories
- `streamlit-detection-tracking - app/app.py` - Added mapping functionality

---

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Start with Option 1 (Category Mapping)** because:
1. It works immediately with your existing model
2. The mapping is logical and covers all your desired categories
3. You can always retrain later if needed
4. It saves time and computational resources

---

## 🔧 **Testing Your Solution**

### **Test the Category Mapper:**
```bash
python category_mapper.py
```

### **Test the Streamlit App:**
1. Launch the app
2. Upload a waste image
3. See the mapped results
4. Check the mapping info in the expandable section

### **Expected Output:**
- Model detects: PAPER, PLASTIC, etc.
- App shows: Packaged, Plastic, etc.
- Mapping info explains the conversion

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all files are in the correct locations
2. Ensure your model file exists at the specified path
3. Verify Python dependencies are installed
4. Check the console output for specific error messages
